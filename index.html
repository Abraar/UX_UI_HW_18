        <h1>Prototyping and Wireframing</h1>
        <p>
          I enjoy making wireframes. To me, a successful project rests on the back of a solid foundation, and wireframes are the foundation of design         </p>

        <h1>User Flows</h1>
        <p>
          A user flow is how the user goes through a site, and as a designer, it's my job and passion to coordinate the site so it goes with how the user uses it, and not against it.         </p>

        <h1>Design Thinking
        </h1>
        <p>
          To me, a good design is something that an average user would not notice, but is guided by it without knowing they are being guided.         </p>
